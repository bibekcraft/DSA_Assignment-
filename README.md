## Introduction
This project consists of two main components:
1. **NetworkOptimizer**: A Java-based application that optimizes network traffic using specific algorithms (details on optimization algorithms can be added).
2. **Tetris Game**: A simple implementation of the Tetris game using Java, showcasing basic game mechanics and GUI design.

Both components are part of the same repository and utilize NetBeans as the IDE for development.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following:
- **NetBeans IDE** installed (you can download it [here](https://netbeans.apache.org/)).
- **Java JDK** (version 8 or above) installed.
- A database (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) set up for running the SQL script. (If using MySQL, make sure to install and configure it).
- **Database Connection**: You'll need to set up the JDBC connection to your database.

## Setup Instructions
